# mini_mips_34
 VHDL implementation for a simple five stage pipelined processor, Mini-MIPS, which is a subset of the 32-bit MIPS architecture . Mini-MIPS uses the same 3 instruction formats of MIPS (R, I and J-types) to implement following 10 instructions:  ADD, SUB, ADDI, SUBI, AND, OR, LW, SW, JR and BEQZ.
